# Web-Scrapper-Crawler-

The Python program that I created extracts the absolute unique web links from the HTML code of the “Current Estimates” web link by first importing requests from the BeautifulSoup4 library to parse the HTML. By using BS4, the program is able to parse the HTML by searching for tags along with their children that contain specific elements with desired attributes, such as the those of URL web links. Once the HTML is examined, the links containing <a href> are extracted via soup function. This creates a list of each URL within the HTML of the “Current Estimates” web link. Foremost, the program takes the results from the search for tags containing <a href> and removes the duplicates, then repopulates the new list of results cleaned and free of redundant URLs. Then, the results of the extracted URIs are converted into a CSV file via script thus, It is in this way, how my Python program successfully extracts the unique web links from the HTML code
