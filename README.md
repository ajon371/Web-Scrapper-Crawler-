# Web-Scrapper-Crawler-

The Python program that I created extracts the absolute unique web links from the HTML code of the “Current Estimates” web link by first importing requests from the BeautifulSoup4 library to parse the HTML. By using BS4, the program is able to parse the HTML by searching for tags along with their children that contain specific elements with desired attributes, such as the those of URL web links.
